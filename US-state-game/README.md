This project lets users play an interactive game where they need to input all 50
states in the US. A US map is displayed with the names of each state as the user answers each
states.

The Turtle module is used to implement the names of each states that is displayed in the appropriate coordinates, as well
as the scoreboard and the dialog box.

It reads from and saves to a CSV file.
