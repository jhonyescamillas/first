The TurtleCrossing project lets users play Turtle Crossing. The goal of the game 
is to get the turtle to get across to the top of the screen without getting hit 
by passing cars. The UP arrow moves the turtle. 

The program utilizes the Turtle module to represent the turtle (player), the random cars
that pass by and the scoreboard.
